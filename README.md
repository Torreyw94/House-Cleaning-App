<h1>House Cleaning Mobile App (Business App)</h1>

<h2>Tools I have used</h2>

- <b>Android Studio</b> 
- <b>Java</b>
- <b>Firebase Cloud Database</b>



<h2>Description: </h2>
In this project, I created a house-cleaning mobile app that is used to help customers schedule an appointment time for a cleaning service. They can select one of the services they need assistance with and then select the best available time. Then they will receive a notification on the app that their appointment is booked with a confirmation email.
The goal of this project is to save time for this house cleaning business so that they don't have to schedule every person who calls for a cleaning service.


<h2>Summary</h2>

There are a lot of key takeaways I have learned from building this project. Here is a list of what I have accomplished:

  1. I created a registered page that allows users to make an account.
  2. I have used Firebase which stores their credential information in that database, once the user is finished with registering their account.
  3. I have also implemented a feature that verifies if the email they entered is valid.
  4. On the login tab, I implemented a feature that verifies their account just so that there are no bots on this app.
  5. On the login tab, I implemented a forgot password which sends a reset password to the email account they created.
  6. On the home tab, the user can scroll down and see what kind of services the business offers.
  7. On the schedule tab, I used an API that has a built-in time schedule that connects to the Firebase database. This allows the user to select a date/time that is available and store their time picked in the database.
  8. On the Notification tab, this will show their appointment has been booked and details about their appointment.
  9. On the Settings tab, they can update their profile information if they need to.
